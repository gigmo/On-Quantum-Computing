# On-Quantum-Computing
My goal is to learn and understand the basics of quantum computing to allow me to carry out my own quantum computing simulations and conduct statistical analysis on it. This is a 6 month journey and throughout, I include some detail of the prerequisites of a project as this and how you can replicate it :)
